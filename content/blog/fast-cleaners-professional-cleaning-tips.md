Keeping your space clean between professional cleaning sessions doesn't have to be overwhelming. Our FAST CLEANERS experts share their top tips for maintaining a spotless environment.

1. **The 10-Minute Daily Tidy**: Spend just 10 minutes each day tidying up high-traffic areas like the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. This prevents clutter from building up and makes weekly cleaning much easier.

2. **Clean as You Go**: The best cleaning habit is to address messes immediately. Wipe down the kitchen counter after cooking, clean spills right away, and put things back in their place after use.

3. **Invest in Quality Cleaning Tools**: Good microfiber cloths, a reliable vacuum, and the right cleaning solutions make a huge difference. Cheap tools often spread dirt rather than remove it.

4. **Focus on High-Touch Surfaces**: Door handles, light switches, remote controls, and phone screens harbor the most germs. Wipe these down daily with disinfectant for a healthier space.

5. **Schedule Professional Deep Cleans**: Even with regular maintenance, scheduling a professional deep clean monthly or quarterly ensures that hidden dirt, dust, and bacteria are thoroughly eliminated. That's where FAST CLEANERS comes in — we handle the tough jobs so you don't have to.
